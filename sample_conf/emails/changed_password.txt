Hey {{user.full_name}},

Someone recently changed the password on your {{config.client.name}} account.  If this was you, then all is well, and you can disregard this message.  However, if you suspect your account is being hacked, you might want to consider using the "**Forgot Password**" feature (located on the login page) to reset your password.

Here is the information we gathered from the request:

- **Date/Time:** {{date_time}}
- **IP Address:** {{ip}}
- **User Agent:** {{request.headers.user-agent}}
