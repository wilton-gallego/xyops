## Orchestra Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Orchestra's website and back-end web service.

### Information we collect

When you create an account with Orchestra, you must provide a username, a password, an email address, and your name.  These are stored securely on our servers.  Your password is encrypted (see **Security** below).

Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.

We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in.

Our server software also stores basic technical information, such as your [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) and [user agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent), in security logs which are made available to you in the web user interface.  These logs are provided as a security measure, so you can see who else is using your account, when and from where.

### Data retention

Email messages are stored for up to 5 years on our servers.  After that they are automatically deleted.  This also applies to any attachments you upload.

Our server logs are kept for 30 days.

### Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

### Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS (SSL), and thus is fully end-to-end encrypted. Passwords are [hashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)).

### Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Orchestra website at any time.

Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 30 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.

Orchestra may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal concerns, abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.

### Third-party links and content

Orchestra is **not responsible** for the message content of its users.

Orchestra may display links to third-party sites, if users post email messages containing these links.  These sites have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

### Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

### Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email support@orchestra.dev. Please note that account deletion should be done within the Orchestra website, not via email requests, for security reasons.
