# API Reference

## Overview

This document details the xyOps REST API and API Key system.  All API calls expect JSON as input (unless they are simple HTTP GETs), and will return JSON as output.  The main API endpoint is:

```
https://SERVER/api/app/NAME/v1
```

Replace `NAME` with the specific API function you are calling (see below for list).  All requests should be HTTP GET or HTTP POST as the API dictates, and should be directed at your xyOps primary server.  Example URL:

```
http://sample.west.xyops.io/api/app/search_jobs/v1
```

## API Keys

API Keys allow you to register external applications or services to use the REST API.  These can be thought of as special user accounts specifically for applications.  Each API key can be granted a specific set of privileges.

To create an API Key, you must first be an administrator level user.  Login to the xyOps UI, proceed to the **API Keys** tab, and click the "Add API Key..." button.  Fill out the form and click the "Create Key" button at the bottom of the page.

API Keys are randomly generated alphanumeric strings, and are 24 characters in length by default.  They **are** case sensitive.  Example:

```
muJm8T6QSzqQzuO6MvbOdtlB
```

You must include a valid API Key with every API request.  There are three ways to do this: include a `X-API-Key` HTTP request header, an `api_key` query string parameter, or an `api_key` JSON property.

Here is a raw HTTP request showing all three methods of passing the API Key (only one of these is required):

```
GET /api/app/search_jobs/v1?api_key=muJm8T6QSzqQzuO6MvbOdtlB HTTP/1.1
Host: sample.west.xyops.io
X-API-Key: muJm8T6QSzqQzuO6MvbOdtlB
Content-Type: application/json

{"query": "*", "offset": 0, "limit": 50, "api_key": "muJm8T6QSzqQzuO6MvbOdtlB"}
```

## Standard Response Format

Regardless of the specific API call you requested, all responses will be in JSON format, and include at the very least a `code` property.  This will be set to `0` upon success, or any other value if an error occurred.  In the event of an error, a `description` property will also be included, containing the error message itself.  Individual API calls may include additional properties, but these two are standard fare in all cases.  Example successful response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

Example error response:

```json
{
	"code": "session", 
	"description": "No Session ID or API Key could be found"
}
```

## Alerts

Alert APIs manage alert definitions. Use these endpoints to list, fetch, create, update, and delete alerts that evaluate monitor data and trigger actions (email, web hooks, snapshots, and more). Alerts run on the conductor and evaluate incoming monitor samples from servers; results appear in monitoring views and the activity log. Editing alerts typically requires appropriate privileges; read operations only require a valid session or API Key.

See [Alerts](alerts.md) for details on the xyOps alert system.

### get_alerts

```
GET /api/app/get_alerts/v1
```

This fetches all the current alert definitions.  No input parameters are defined.  No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all alerts, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination). Example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"rows": [
		{
			"id": "load_avg_high",
			"title": "High CPU Load",
			"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)",
			"message": "CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)",
			"groups": [],
			"email": "",
			"web_hook": "",
			"monitor_id": "load_avg",
			"enabled": true,
			"samples": 1,
			"notes": "",
			"username": "admin",
			"modified": 1434125333,
			"created": 1434125333
		}
	],
	"list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include a `rows` array containing information about every alert definition, and a `list` object containing list metadata.

See [Alert](data.md#alert) for details on the properties on each alert.

### get_alert

```
GET /api/app/get_alert/v1
```

This fetches a single alert definition given its ID. No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key.  Both a HTTP GET with query string parameters and a HTTP POST with JSON are allowed.  The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the alert to fetch. |

Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "load_avg_high"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"alert": {
		"id": "load_avg_high",
		"title": "High CPU Load",
		"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)",
		"message": "CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)",
		"groups": [],
		"email": "",
		"web_hook": "",
		"monitor_id": "load_avg",
		"enabled": true,
		"samples": 1,
		"notes": "",
		"username": "admin",
		"modified": 1434125333,
		"created": 1434125333
	}
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include an `alert` object containing information about the requested alert.

See [Alert](data.md#alert) for details on the alert properties.

### create_alert

```
POST /api/app/create_alert/v1
```

This creates a new alert definition.  The [create_alerts](privileges.md#create_alerts) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.   The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.  See [Alert](data.md#alert) for details on the input properties.  The `id`, `username`, `created` and `modified` properties may be omitted, as they are automatically generated.  Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"title": "High CPU Load",
	"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)",
	"message": "CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)",
	"groups": [],
	"email": "",
	"web_hook": "",
	"monitor_id": "load_avg",
	"enabled": true,
	"samples": 1,
	"notes": ""
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"alert": {...}
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include an `alert` object containing the alert that was just created (including all the auto-generated properties).

See [Alert](data.md#alert) for details on the alert properties.

### update_alert

```
POST /api/app/update_alert/v1
```

This updates an existing alert definition, specified by its ID.  The [edit_alerts](privileges.md#edit_alerts) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.  The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.  See [Alert](data.md#alert) for details on the input properties.  The request is "shallow-merged" into the existing alert, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update.  Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "load_avg_high",
	"title": "High CPU Load",
	"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

The above example would update the `title` and `expression` of the alert with ID `load_avg_high`.  The other properties in the alert will not be touched (except for `modified` which is always updated, and some other internal properties).

### test_alert

```
POST /api/app/test_alert/v1
```

This tests an alert configuration, specifically the `expression` and `message` properties, against a specified server.  It tests both the syntax of the properties by pre-compiling them, and it also evaluates them against the specified server data, so you can see if the alert would fire given current conditions.  The [edit_alerts](privileges.md#edit_alerts) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.  The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.  The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `server` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the server to test the expression and message on. |
| `expression` | String | **(Required)** The alert expression to test. |
| `message` | String | **(Required)** The alert message to test. |

Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"server": "s12345abcde",
	"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)",
	"message": "CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"result": false,
	"message": "CPU load average is too high: 2.5 (2 CPU cores)"
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include a `result` boolean indicating whether the alert would fire given the current server data, and a `message` string containing the evaluated message.

### delete_alert

```
POST /api/app/delete_alert/v1
```

This deletes an alert definition, specified by its ID. The [delete_alerts](privileges.md#delete_alerts) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key. The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body. The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the alert to delete. |

Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "load_avg_high"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

## Buckets

A storage bucket is a logical container for storing files, for use in events and workflows. Buckets can hold an arbitrary number of files, and JSON data.

Bucket APIs define and manage buckets, their metadata, data blobs and file lists. Use them to list, fetch, create, update, and delete buckets; and to upload/download/delete files associated with a bucket. Jobs and workflows can read and write bucket content at runtime (e.g., exchange inputs/outputs). Metadata operations typically require create/edit/delete privileges; listing and fetching only require a valid session or API Key.

### get_buckets

```
GET /api/app/get_buckets/v1
```

This fetches all the current storage bucket definitions (sans actual data and files).  No input parameters are defined.  No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all buckets, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination). Example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"rows": [
		{
			"id": "bme4wi6pg35",
			"title": "The Void",
			"enabled": true,
			"icon": "",
			"notes": "",
			"username": "admin",
			"modified": 1754783050,
			"created": 1754783023,
			"revision": 2
		}
	],
	"list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include a `rows` array containing information about every bucket definition, and a `list` object containing list metadata.

See [Bucket](data.md#bucket) for details on the properties on each bucket.

### get_bucket

```
GET /api/app/get_bucket/v1
```

This retrieves the definition of a specific storage bucket, including its data and file list.  No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key.  Here are the input parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the bucket to retrieve. |

And here is an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"bucket": {
		"id": "bme4wi6pg35",
		"title": "The Void",
		"enabled": true,
		"icon": "",
		"notes": "",
		"username": "admin",
		"modified": 1754783050,
		"created": 1754783023,
		"revision": 2
	},
	"data": {
		"foo": "Hello this is a bucket"
	},
	"files": [
		{
			"id": "fme4wijr73h",
			"date": 1754783040,
			"filename": "test.png",
			"path": "files/bucket/bme4wi6pg35/bdY8zZ9nKynfFUb4xH6fA/test.png",
			"size": 92615,
			"username": "admin"
		}
	]
}
```

See [Bucket](data.md#bucket) for details on the properties in the `bucket` object.  The `data` object will be populated with the bucket data, which is all user-defined.  The `files` array is a list of all the files in the bucket, if any.  To download a file, use the `path` property, prepended with the app's base URL (and a slash).

### create_bucket

```
POST /api/app/create_bucket/v1
```

This creates a new storage bucket.  The [create_buckets](privileges.md#create_buckets) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.   The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.  See [Bucket](data.md#bucket) for details on the input properties.  The `id`, `username`, `created` and `modified` properties may be omitted, as they are automatically generated.  Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"title": "The Void",
	"enabled": true,
	"icon": "",
	"notes": "",
	"data": {
		"foo": "Hello this is a bucket"
	}
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0,
	"bucket": {...}
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this API will also include a `bucket` object containing the bucket that was just created (including all the auto-generated properties).

As you can see in the above example, you can specify the user-defined bucket data along with the creation of the bucket itself.  Bucket files, however, need to be uploaded separately (see [upload_bucket_files](#upload_bucket_files)).

See [Bucket](data.md#bucket) for details on the bucket properties.

### update_bucket

```
POST /api/app/update_bucket/v1
```

This updates an existing storage bucket, specified by its ID.  The [edit_buckets](privileges.md#edit_buckets) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.  The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.  See [Bucket](data.md#bucket) for details on the input properties.  The request is "shallow-merged" into the existing bucket, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update.  Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "bme4wi6pg35",
	"title": "The Void",
	"data": {
		"foo": "Hello this is a bucket"
	}
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

The above example would update the `title` and `data` of the bucket with ID `bme4wi6pg35`.  The other properties in the bucket will not be touched (except for `modified` which is always updated, and some other internal properties).

### delete_bucket

```
POST /api/app/delete_bucket/v1
```

This deletes a storage bucket, including all data and files, specified by its ID. The [delete_buckets](privileges.md#delete_buckets) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key. The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body. The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the bucket to delete. |

Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "bme4wi6pg35"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

### upload_bucket_files

```
POST /api/app/upload_bucket_files/v1
```

This API allows you to upload files into a storage bucket.  Unlike most of the other APIs, this one handles files, so it requires a `multipart/form-data` style request.  The parameters should be actual HTTP POST parameters, rather than JSON keys.  The [edit_buckets](privileges.md#edit_buckets) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key.  The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `bucket` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the bucket to upload files to. |

The file properties are automatically set based on the user files themselves, including the filename, file size, etc.  The `bucket` parameter is used to specify the target bucket for the upload.

Note that bucket files are automatically added or replaced based on their normalized filenames.  Normalization involves converting anything other than alphanumerics, dashes and periods to underscores, and converting the filename to lowercase.

### delete_bucket_file

```
POST /api/app/delete_bucket_file/v1
```

This API deletes a file from a storage bucket. The [edit_buckets](privileges.md#edit_buckets) privilege is required, as well as a valid user session or API Key. The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body. The input parameters are as follows:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the bucket to delete the file from. |
| `filename` | String | **(Required)** The normalized filename of the file to delete. |
	
Here is an example request:

```json
{
	"id": "bme4wi6pg35",
	"filename": "test.png"
}
```

And an example response:

```json
{
	"code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

## Categories

Category APIs organize events into logical groups for navigation, access control and search. Use them to list, fetch, create, update, reorder, and delete categories. Assigning an event to a category affects user visibility (via roles) and search filtering. Editing categories typically requires privileges; reading only requires a valid session or API Key.

### get_categories

```
GET /api/app/get_categories/v1
```

Fetch all category definitions. No input parameters are required. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key. In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), the response includes a `rows` array of categories and a `list` object with summary metadata. The `list.length` value is the total number of categories (without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "general",
            "title": "General",
            "enabled": true,
            "sort_order": 0,
            "username": "admin",
            "modified": 1754365754,
            "created": 1754365754,
            "notes": "For events that don't fit anywhere else.",
            "color": "plain",
            "icon": "",
            "limits": [],
            "actions": [],
            "revision": 1
        }
        
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Category](data.md#category) for details on category properties.

### get_category

```
GET /api/app/get_category/v1
```

Fetch a single category definition by ID. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key. Both HTTP GET with query string parameters and HTTP POST with JSON are accepted. Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the category to fetch. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "general"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "category": {
        "id": "general",
        "title": "General",
        "enabled": true,
        "sort_order": 0,
        "username": "admin",
        "modified": 1754365754,
        "created": 1754365754,
        "notes": "For events that don't fit anywhere else.",
        "color": "plain",
        "icon": "",
        "limits": [],
        "actions": [],
        "revision": 1
    }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `category` property containing the requested category definition.  See [Category](data.md#category) for details on category properties.

### create_category

```
POST /api/app/create_category/v1
```

Create a new category. Requires the [create_categories](privileges.md#create_categories) privilege and category-level access to the specified ID (for category-limited accounts), plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. See [Category](data.md#category) for property details. The `id` may be omitted and will be auto-generated; `username`, `created`, `modified`, `revision`, and `sort_order` are set by the server.

Example request:

```json
{
    "title": "General",
    "enabled": true,
    "color": "plain",
    "icon": "",
    "notes": "For events that don't fit anywhere else.",
    "limits": [],
    "actions": []
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "category": { /* full category object including auto-generated fields */ }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `category` property containing the full category object including auto-generated fields.

Notes:

- The server validates [Limits](data.md#limit) and [Actions](data.md#action).
- `sort_order` is automatically assigned at the end of the current list.

### update_category

```
POST /api/app/update_category/v1
```

Update an existing category by ID. Requires the [edit_categories](privileges.md#edit_categories) privilege and category-level access to the specified ID (for category-limited accounts), plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. The request is shallow-merged into the existing category, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update. The server updates `modified` and increments `revision` automatically.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The category ID to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Category](data.md#category) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `color`, `notes`, `limits`, `actions`). |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "general",
    "title": "General Jobs",
    "color": "blue"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

See [Limit](data.md#limit) and [Action](data.md#action) for nested structures.

### delete_category

```
POST /api/app/delete_category/v1
```

Delete an existing category by ID. Requires the [delete_categories](privileges.md#delete_categories) privilege and category-level access to the specified ID (for category-limited accounts), plus a valid user session or API Key. Deletion is blocked if any [Events](data.md#event) are assigned to the category.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The category ID to delete. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "general"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

### multi_update_category

```
POST /api/app/multi_update_category/v1
```

Update multiple categories in a single call. This endpoint is intended for updating `sort_order` only (e.g., after drag-and-drop reordering in the UI). Requires the [edit_categories](privileges.md#edit_categories) privilege and category-level access to all categories (`*`), plus a valid user session or API Key.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `items` | Array<Object> | **(Required)** Array of objects, each with an `id` and the new `sort_order`. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "items": [
        { "id": "general", "sort_order": 0 },
        { "id": "logs",    "sort_order": 1 }
    ]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

Notes:

- Only `sort_order` is updated by this endpoint.
- `modified` and `revision` are not updated by design for multi-updates of sort order.



## Channels

Channel APIs manage notification channels (e.g., email lists, user mentions, optional web hook or follow-up job). Use them to list, fetch, create, update, and delete channels that alerts or actions can target. Channels centralize how notifications are delivered so events and alerts can reference them by ID. Editing channels requires privileges; listing and fetching require a valid session or API Key.

### get_channels

```
GET /api/app/get_channels/v1
```

Fetch all notification channel definitions. No input parameters are required. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all channels, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "sev1",
            "title": "Severity 1",
            "enabled": true,
            "username": "admin",
            "modified": 1754603045,
            "created": 1754365754,
            "notes": "For major events that require everyone's attention right away.",
            "users": ["admin"],
            "email": "",
            "web_hook": "",
            "run_event": "",
            "sound": "attention-3.mp3",
            "icon": "",
            "revision": 3,
            "max_per_day": 0
        }
        
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Channel](data.md#channel) for details on channel properties.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `channel` object containing the newly created channel.

### update_channel

```
POST /api/app/update_channel/v1
```

Update an existing channel by ID. Requires the [edit_channels](privileges.md#edit_channels) privilege, plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. The request is shallow-merged into the existing channel, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update. The server updates `modified` and increments `revision` automatically.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The channel ID to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Channel](data.md#channel) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `users`, `email`, `web_hook`, `run_event`, `sound`, `icon`, `max_per_day`, `notes`). |

    "id": "sev1"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.



## Events

Event APIs define jobs to run (what, when, and how). Use them to list, fetch, create, update, delete events, and to trigger runs immediately. Events reference plugins, categories, secrets, schedules/triggers and actions; creating or editing events enforces parameter validation and user privileges. Running events launches jobs on target servers based on the scheduler and routing configuration.

### get_events

```
GET /api/app/get_events/v1
```

Fetch all event definitions. No input parameters are required. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all events, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "event100",
            "title": "Diverse heuristic complexity",
            "enabled": true,
            "username": "admin",
            "modified": 1653843747,
            "created": 1651348186,
            "category": "cat9",
            "targets": ["main"],
            "notes": "This is a test event.",
            "limits": [
                { "type": "time", "enabled": true, "duration": 3600 }
            ],
            "actions": [
                { "enabled": true, "condition": "error", "type": "email", "email": "admin@localhost" }
            ],
            "plugin": "shellplug",
            "params": { "script": "#!/bin/bash\n\nsleep 30;\necho HELLO;\n", "annotate": false, "json": false },
            "triggers": [
                { "type": "schedule", "enabled": true, "hours": [19], "minutes": [6] }
            ],
            "icon": "",
            "tags": ["important"],
            "algo": "random"
        }
        
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Event](data.md#event) for details on event properties.

### get_event

```
GET /api/app/get_event/v1
```

Fetch a single event definition by ID. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key. Both HTTP GET with query string parameters and HTTP POST with JSON are accepted.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the event to fetch. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "event100"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "event": { /* full event object */ },
    "jobs": [ /* currently active jobs for this event */ ],
    "queued": 0
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include an `event` object containing the requested event, a `jobs` array of currently running jobs for the event, and a `queued` number indicating the count of queued jobs.

See [Event](data.md#event) for details on event properties, and [Job](data.md#job) for job properties.

### get_event_history

```
GET /api/app/get_event_history/v1
```

Fetch the revision history for a specific event from the activity log. Requires a valid user session or API Key, and category/target access to the event.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The event ID to fetch history for. |
| `offset` | Number | Optional row offset for pagination. Defaults to `0`. |
| `limit` | Number | Optional row limit for pagination. Defaults to `1`. |
| `sort_by` | String | Optional sort field. Defaults to `_id`. |
| `sort_dir` | Number | Optional sort direction. Use `-1` for descending (default) or `1` for ascending. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "event100",
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 50
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        { "action": "event_update", "username": "admin", "description": "Updated title", "date": 1754784000 }
        
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array of activity records related to the event, and a `list` object with pagination metadata.

### create_event

```
POST /api/app/create_event/v1
```

Create a new event. Requires the [create_events](privileges.md#create_events) privilege, plus category/target access for the event, and a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. See [Event](data.md#event) for property details. The `id` may be omitted and will be auto-generated; `username`, `created`, and `modified` are set by the server.

Notes:

- For non-workflow events, `targets` and `plugin` are required.
- For workflow events (`type: "workflow"`), the server sets `plugin` to `_workflow` and requires a `workflow` object; `targets` are not required.
- Locked plugin/event parameters are enforced for non-admins and required fields are validated.

Example request (non-workflow event):

```json
{
    "title": "Diverse heuristic complexity",
    "enabled": true,
    "category": "cat9",
    "targets": ["main"],
    "plugin": "shellplug",
    "params": { "script": "#!/bin/bash\necho HELLO\n" },
    "triggers": [ { "type": "manual", "enabled": true } ]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "event": { /* full event object including auto-generated fields */ }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include an `event` object containing the newly created event.

### update_event

```
POST /api/app/update_event/v1
```

Update an existing event by ID. Requires the [edit_events](privileges.md#edit_events) privilege, plus category/target access to the event, and a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. The request is shallow-merged into the existing event, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update. The server updates `modified` and increments `revision` automatically.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The event ID to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Event](data.md#event) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `category`, `targets`, `algo`, `plugin`, `params`, `triggers`, `limits`, `actions`, `notes`). |

Special behavior:

- Non-admins have locked plugin/event parameters enforced; required fields must be present.
- You can update per-event state by passing `update_state` as an object of key/value pairs. These are stored in event state and removed from the event record itself.

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "event100",
    "title": "Diverse heuristic complexity (v2)",
    "limits": [ { "type": "time", "enabled": true, "duration": 1800 } ],
    "update_state": { "cursor": 1234 }
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

The `update_state` is used to reset the event's time cursor for [Catch-Up](triggers.md#catch-up) mode.

### delete_event

```
POST /api/app/delete_event/v1
```

Delete an existing event by ID. Requires the [delete_events](privileges.md#delete_events) privilege, plus category/target access to the event, and a valid user session or API Key. Deletion is blocked if any jobs are active for the event. You may optionally request deletion of all historical jobs for the event.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The event ID to delete. |
| `delete_jobs` | Boolean | Optional. If `true`, delete all historical jobs for the event (performed in background). |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "event100",
    "delete_jobs": true
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

### run_event

```
POST /api/app/run_event/v1
```

Run an event on demand with optional overrides and optional file uploads. Requires the [run_jobs](privileges.md#run_jobs) privilege, plus category/target access to the event, and a valid user session or API Key.

Manual run rules:

- The event must have an enabled `manual` trigger, unless you pass `test: true`.
- Disabled events cannot be run unless you pass `test: true`.

Input formats:

- Pure JSON: Send `Content-Type: application/json` with a JSON body.
- Multipart form-data (for file uploads): Send `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` and include a `json` field containing the full JSON payload (as a string), plus one or more file fields. All uploaded files are attached to `input.files` for the job.

Parameters (core):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | The event ID to run. One of `id` or `title` is required. |
| `title` | String | The event title to run (alternative to `id`). |
| `params` | Object | Optional overrides for [Event.params](data.md#event-params). Missing keys fall back to the event's saved params. |
| `input` | Object | Optional input object; may include `data` and/or `files` (see [Job.input](data.md#job-input)). Uploaded files are appended to `input.files`. |
| `test` | Boolean | If `true`, bypasses manual-trigger and enabled checks and marks the job as a test. |

Additional behaviors:

- Nested keys using `parent/child` can be supplied as flat parameters (e.g. `params/foo=bar`).
- When using multipart uploads, the `json` field should contain the exact JSON you would otherwise POST.
- If the `post_data` query parameter is present, all raw POST fields are placed under `post_data` instead of being merged (advanced usage).
- Non-admins have locked plugin/event parameters enforced; required fields must be present.

Example: JSON POST (no files)

```json
{
    "id": "event100",
    "params": { "foo": "bar" },
    "input": { "data": { "greeting": "hello" } }
}
```

Example: multipart/form-data with files

```
POST /api/app/run_event/v1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----XYZ

------XYZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="json"

{"id":"event100","params":{"foo":"bar"}}
------XYZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file1"; filename="input.csv"
Content-Type: text/csv

id,value\n1,alpha\n2,beta\n
------XYZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file2"; filename="notes.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

hello world
------XYZ--
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "id": "jabc123def" 
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include an `id` property containing the newly created [Job.id](data.md#job-id).



## Files

File APIs upload user files, attach files to running jobs, upload job input files before launch, serve files, and delete files associated with a job. These endpoints are designed for both browser uploads and programmatic use; most require only a valid session or API Key, while job-specific operations may require additional privileges.

### upload_files

```
POST /api/app/upload_files/v1
```

Upload one or more files for the authenticated user. This is a general-purpose upload endpoint (not tied to any specific job). Requires a valid user session or API Key. Use `multipart/form-data` with one or more file fields.

Notes:

- Files are stored under a user-specific path and automatically expire per server configuration (see [file_expiration](config.md#file_expiration)).
- Field names are arbitrary; all files in the request are processed.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `urls` array of absolute URLs for the uploaded files.

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "urls": [
        "https://example.xyops.io/files/admin/report.csv"
    ]
}
```

### upload_job_file

```
POST /api/app/upload_job_file/v1
```

Upload a file and associate it with a running job. This endpoint is primarily used by the satellite agent (xySat), and is not designed for external use. Requires authentication via one of three methods below and `multipart/form-data` with a single file field named `file1`.

Authentication methods:

- API Key: Provide a valid API key via standard mechanisms (e.g., `X-API-Key` header or `api_key` param). For convenience, you may also pass it in an `auth` parameter.
- Server token: Provide `server` (Server ID) and `auth` (a server token). The satellite computes this token; it's verified by the primary.
- Job token: Provide `auth` computed for the job. The satellite computes this token; it's verified by the primary.

Parameters (form + query):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The running [Job.id](data.md#job-id). |
| `auth` | String | **(Required)** Authentication token or API key (see above). |
| `server` | String | Optional. Required only for the server token method. |
| `file1` | File | **(Required)** The uploaded file content (multipart field name must be `file1`). |

Example multipart request (pseudocode):

```
POST /api/app/upload_job_file/v1?id=jabc123def&auth=...&server=main
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----XYZ

------XYZ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file1"; filename="log.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

hello
------XYZ--
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "key": "files/jobs/jabc123def/Y2Jh.../log.txt",
    "size": 5338
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `key` (storage path) and `size` (bytes). You can later fetch the file with `GET /{key}` relative to your base URL (see [file](#file)).

### delete_job_file

```
POST /api/app/delete_job_file/v1
```

Delete a file previously attached to a job. Requires a valid session or API Key with the [delete_jobs](privileges.md#delete_jobs) privilege, and category/target access to the job's event. Supports HTTP POST with JSON, or HTTP GET with query parameters.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The [Job.id](data.md#job-id). |
| `path` | String | **(Required)** The exact storage path of the file to delete.  Must be a file attached to the specified job. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "jabc123def",
    "path": "files/jobs/jabc123def/Y2Jh.../log.txt"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0
}
```

The file is removed from storage and the job's `files` list.  To be clear, this API does not allow file deletion given any arbitrary storage path.  The specified `path` must be registered as a file inside the given job object, or else the API returns an error.

### upload_job_input_files

```
POST /api/app/upload_job_input_files/v1
```

Upload one or more files intended as input to a job before it starts (e.g., from the Run Event dialog). Requires a valid session or API Key with the [run_jobs](privileges.md#run_jobs) privilege. Use `multipart/form-data` with one or more file fields.

Notes:

- Files automatically expire per [client.job_upload_settings.user_file_expiration](config.md#client-job_upload_settings) in server configuration.
- The response provides metadata that can be supplied to `run_event` under `input.files`.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `files` array with metadata for each uploaded file.

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "files": [
        {
            "id": "fme4wijr73h",
            "date": 1754783040,
            "filename": "input.csv",
            "path": "files/admin/bdY8zZ9nKynfFUb4xH6fA/input.csv",
            "size": 92615,
            "username": "admin"
        }
        
    ]
}
```

See [Job.files](data.md#job-files) for how these are consumed by jobs.

### file

```
GET /files/...  or  GET /api/app/file/v1?path=...
```

Serve a file from storage. This is a binary/streaming endpoint (not JSON). It supports full GET, HEAD, conditional requests via `ETag` and `If-Modified-Since`, and HTTP Range requests for partial content. You can access files by direct path under `/files/...`, or via `GET /api/app/file/v1?path=...`.

Parameters (query):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `path` | String | When using `/api/app/file/v1`, the relative storage path under `files/` to serve. |
| `download` | String | Optional. If set, forces download. Use `1` to download with the original filename, or supply a custom filename. |

Behavior:

- When content type is or contains `text/html`, downloads are enforced unless `download` is specified, to prevent HTML rendering in the browser.
- Range requests return `206 Partial Content` with `Content-Range` and `Content-Length` headers.
- HEAD requests return headers only, and may return `304 Not Modified` if applicable.

Examples:

- Direct URL: `GET https://example.xyops.io/files/admin/report.csv`
- API form: `GET https://example.xyops.io/api/app/file/v1?path=admin/report.csv&download=1`



## Groups

Group APIs manage server groups used for organizing infrastructure, routing jobs, targeting monitor plugins, and access control. Use them to list, fetch, create, update, and delete groups. Groups influence where jobs and monitors run, and factor into user access restrictions and search filters. Editing groups requires privileges; reading requires a valid session or API Key.

### get_groups

```
GET /api/app/get_groups/v1
```

Fetch all server groups. No input parameters are required. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all groups, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "main",
            "title": "Main Group",
            "hostname_match": ".+",
            "sort_order": 0,
            "username": "admin",
            "modified": 1754365754,
            "created": 1754365754,
            "revision": 1
        }
        
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Group](data.md#group) for details on group properties.

### get_group

```
GET /api/app/get_group/v1
```

Fetch a single group definition by ID. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key. Both HTTP GET with query string parameters and HTTP POST with JSON are accepted.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the group to fetch. |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "main"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "group": {
        "id": "main",
        "title": "Main Group",
        "hostname_match": ".+",
        "sort_order": 0,
        "username": "admin",
        "modified": 1754365754,
        "created": 1754365754,
        "revision": 1
    }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `group` object containing the requested group.

See [Group](data.md#group) for details on group properties.

### create_group

```
POST /api/app/create_group/v1
```

Create a new server group. Requires the [create_groups](privileges.md#create_groups) privilege and group-level access to the specified ID, plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. See [Group](data.md#group) for property details. The `id` may be omitted and will be auto-generated; `username`, `created`, `modified`, `revision`, and `sort_order` are set by the server.

Parameters (required fields):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `title` | String | **(Required)** Visual name for the group. |
| `hostname_match` | String | **(Required)** A regular expression string used to auto-match servers to the group. |

Example request:

```json
{

    "group": { /* full group object including auto-generated fields */ }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `group` object containing the newly created group.

Notes:

## Plugins

Plugin APIs manage extensions that implement custom behavior in xyOps (event runners, monitors, actions, and scheduler triggers). Use them to list, fetch, create, update, and delete plugins. Plugins encapsulate executables and parameters and can receive secrets; they are referenced by events and the monitoring system. Creating/updating plugins requires privileges; list/fetch requires a valid session or API Key.

### get_plugins

```
GET /api/app/get_plugins/v1
```

Fetch all plugin definitions. No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all plugins, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "shellplug",
            "title": "Shell Script",
            "enabled": true,
            "command": "[shell-plugin]",
            "username": "admin",

            ],
            "revision": 1
        }
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Plugin](data.md#plugin) for details on the plugin object and all its properties.

### get_plugin

See [Plugin](data.md#plugin) for details on the input properties. The `id`, `username`, `created`, `modified` and `revision` properties may be omitted, as they are automatically generated (a unique `id` will be assigned if omitted, and the initial `revision` will be set to `1`). The `type` property must be one of: `event`, `monitor`, `action`, or `scheduler`. If you include [Plugin.params](data.md#plugin-params), they must follow the documented schema and will be validated.

Example request:

```json
{
    "title": "Shell Script",
    "enabled": true,
    "type": "event",
    "command": "[shell-plugin]",

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the plugin to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Plugin](data.md#plugin) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `type`, `command`, `script`, `params`, `groups`, `format`, `uid`, `gid`, `kill`, `icon`, `notes`). |

Example request:

```json
{
    "id": "shellplug",
    "title": "Shell Script (Updated)",
    "enabled": false
}
```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }

Secrets are passed to jobs as environment variables when access is granted via any of the following metadata lists on the secret:

- `events`: Grant to specific [Event.id](data.md#event-id) jobs.
- `categories`: Grant to all events in selected [Category.id](data.md#category-id)s.
- `plugins`: Grant to specific [Plugin.id](data.md#plugin-id) jobs when these plugins are launched.

Jobs automatically receive the variables without calling any API; the system decrypts and injects them at launch time. Variable names follow POSIX environment rules and are listed in [Secret.names](data.md#secret-names). To view or edit values in the UI, an administrator can use [decrypt_secret](#decrypt_secret); accesses are recorded in the activity log.

Web hooks can expand secret variables using template syntax like `{{ secrets.VAR_NAME }}` when the secret grants access via the `web_hooks` list. See [Secret.web_hooks](data.md#secret-web_hooks).

### get_secrets

```
GET /api/app/get_secrets/v1
```

Fetch all secret metadata. No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key. Note that this returns only secret metadata; the actual secret variable data is stored separately and encrypted.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all secrets, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "zmeejkeb8nu",
            "title": "Dev Database Creds",
            "enabled": true,
            "icon": "",
            "notes": "This secret provides access to the dev database.",
            "names": ["DB_HOST", "DB_PASS", "DB_USER"],
            "events": ["emeekm2ablu"],
            "categories": [],
            "plugins": [],
            "web_hooks": ["example_hook"],

            "revision": 8
        }
    ],
    "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [Secret](data.md#secret) for details on the secret object and its properties. The actual encrypted data structure is described under [Secret.fields](data.md#secret-fields).

### get_secret

```
GET /api/app/get_secret/v1
```

Fetch a single secret's metadata by ID. No specific privilege is required, besides a valid user session or API Key. Both a HTTP GET with query string parameters and a HTTP POST with JSON are allowed. This returns only metadata; not the encrypted variable values.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the secret to fetch. |

Example request:

```json
{ "id": "zmeejkeb8nu" }
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "secret": {
        "id": "zmeejkeb8nu",
        "title": "Dev Database Creds",
        "enabled": true,
        "icon": "",
        "notes": "This secret provides access to the dev database.",
        "names": ["DB_HOST", "DB_PASS", "DB_USER"],
        "events": ["emeekm2ablu"],

        "created": 1755365953,
        "revision": 8
    }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `secret` object containing the requested secret metadata. To retrieve and decrypt the actual variable values, use [decrypt_secret](#decrypt_secret).

See [Secret](data.md#secret) for details on the metadata fields.

### decrypt_secret

```
GET /api/app/decrypt_secret/v1
```

Decrypt and return a secret's variable data. Admin only. Requires a valid administrator session or API Key. Both a HTTP GET with query string parameters and a HTTP POST with JSON are allowed.

Access to this API is logged as a transaction in the activity log (action type `secret_access`), tagged with the requesting username.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the secret to decrypt. |

Example request:

```json
{ "id": "zmeejkeb8nu" }
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "fields": [
        { "name": "DB_HOST", "value": "db.dev.internal" },
        { "name": "DB_USER", "value": "appuser" },
        { "name": "DB_PASS", "value": "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple" }
    ]
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `fields` array containing the decrypted [Secret.fields](data.md#secret-fields) entries.

### create_secret

```
POST /api/app/create_secret/v1
```

Create a new secret and store its encrypted variable data. Admin only. Requires a valid administrator session or API Key. The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.

See [Secret](data.md#secret) for details on the metadata properties. The `id`, `username`, `created`, `modified` and `revision` properties may be omitted, as they are automatically generated (a unique `id` will be assigned if omitted, and the initial `revision` will be set to `1`). Include [Secret.fields](data.md#secret-fields) to define the variable names and values; these will be encrypted and stored separately from the metadata. The `names` list is auto-generated from `fields` and stored in plaintext for display.

Example request:

```json
{
    "title": "Dev Database Creds",
    "enabled": true,
    "icon": "database-lock",
    "notes": "App DB credentials for dev",
    "events": ["emeekm2ablu"],
    "categories": ["cat_dev"],
    "plugins": ["shellplug"],

        { "name": "DB_PASS", "value": "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple" }
    ]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "code": 0,
    "secret": { /* full secret metadata, including auto-generated fields and names; excludes encrypted data */ }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `secret` object containing the created secret metadata. The encrypted variable data is stored separately and is not returned here.

### update_secret

```
POST /api/app/update_secret/v1
```

Update an existing secret's metadata and/or encrypted variable data. Admin only. Requires a valid administrator session or API Key. The request must be sent as an HTTP POST with a JSON body.

See [Secret](data.md#secret) for details on the metadata properties. The request is shallow-merged into the existing secret, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update. If you include [Secret.fields](data.md#secret-fields), the variables will be re-encrypted and stored; the `names` list will be regenerated from the provided field names. The `modified` timestamp is updated automatically, and the `revision` is incremented.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The alphanumeric ID of the secret to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Secret](data.md#secret) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `fields`, `events`, `categories`, `plugins`, `web_hooks`, `icon`, `notes`). |

Example request (metadata-only update):

```json
{
    "id": "zmeejkeb8nu",
    "title": "Dev Database Credentials",
    "enabled": false
}

### update_server

```
POST /api/app/update_server/v1
```

Update server metadata (title, enabled, icon, groups, and auto-grouping). Admin only. Requires a valid administrator session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. The request is shallow-merged into the existing server record.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The server ID to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [Server](data.md#server) fields: e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `icon`, `groups` (array of [Group.id](data.md#group-id)), `autoGroup` (boolean). |

Special behavior:

- If `autoGroup` is `true`, groups are automatically assigned from hostname rules and any provided `groups` are overridden.
- If `autoGroup` is `false`, you may explicitly set `groups`.

Example request:

```json
{
  "id": "sorbstack01",
  "title": "Build Agent A",
  "enabled": true,
  "icon": "server",
  "groups": ["main", "staging"],

```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

### delete_server

```
POST /api/app/delete_server/v1
```

Delete a server and optionally its history. Admin only. Requires a valid administrator session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The server ID to delete. |
| `history` | Boolean | Optional. If `true`, also delete the server record, monitoring data and snapshots. If omitted or `false`, only uninstall the agent when online and keep history. |

Behavior:

- Online + `history: false`: Uninstalls xyOps Satellite and removes the server from the active list; the server record and monitoring history are retained.
- Online + `history: true`: Uninstalls the Satellite, then starts a background job to delete the server record, monitoring data and snapshots.
- Offline: You must pass `history: true` to delete; otherwise the call fails because only uninstall would be possible when online.
- Deletion runs in the background; the response is returned immediately.

Example request (delete including history):

```json
{ "id": "sorbstack01", "history": true }
```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

```

Example request (by number):

```json
{ "num": 24 }
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "ticket": {
    "id": "tmgpmoorz6p",
    "num": 24,
    "subject": "Job #jmgn8f6ib7p failed with code: 1 (BlueSky Test)",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this includes a `ticket` object. See [Ticket](data.md#ticket) for details.

### get_tickets

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `ids` | Array | **(Required)** Array of ticket IDs to fetch. The response preserves this order. |
| `verbose` | Boolean | Optional. If `true`, include heavy fields (`body`, full `changes`). If omitted or `false`, these are pruned. |

Example request:

```json
{ "ids": ["tmgpmoorz6p", "txyz123abcd"], "verbose": false }

    { "id": "tmgpmoorz6p", "num": 24, "subject": "...", "status": "open", "changes": 3 }
  ],
  "list": { "length": 57 }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this includes a `rows` array of [Ticket](data.md#ticket) records and a `list` object with list metadata (e.g., `length` for total rows without pagination). When `compact` is set, `body` is omitted and `changes` is the count of changes.

### create_ticket

```
POST /api/app/create_ticket/v1
```

Create a new ticket. Requires the [create_tickets](privileges.md#create_tickets) privilege and a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST. You may send either JSON, or `multipart/form-data` if uploading files:

- JSON body: Post the ticket fields as JSON.
- Multipart form-data: Send `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` and include a `json` field containing the full JSON payload (as a string), plus one or more file fields. Uploaded files are attached to the ticket.

Parameters (JSON):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Optional. If omitted, a unique ID is generated. Must be alphanumeric if provided. |
| `subject` | String | **(Required)** Short summary for the ticket. HTML is stripped. |
| (Other) | Various | Any [Ticket](data.md#ticket) fields, e.g. `type`, `status`, `category`, `server`, `assignees` (array), `cc` (array), `notify` (array of email), `due` (Unix seconds), `tags` (array), `body` (Markdown). |
| `template` | String | Optional. Auto-generate the `body` from a template. Allowed values: `job` or `alert` (see below). |

When using `multipart/form-data`, attach one or more file fields (any field names). Files are saved and added to [Ticket.files](data.md#ticket-files) with metadata. Files auto-expire per [file_expiration](config.md#file_expiration) configuration setting.

Defaults: If not provided, the server sets `status` to `open`, `body` to an empty string, `due` to `0`, and initializes `changes` with an initial "created" entry.

Example request (JSON):

```json
{
  "subject": "Nightly backup failed on server sorbstack01",

## Web Hooks

Web Hook APIs manage outbound HTTP callbacks used by alerts, job actions and workflows. Use them to list, fetch, create, update, and delete web hook definitions, which can include headers, authentication and templated payloads (including secret expansion). Executions are logged with job activity; editing requires specific privileges.

```

Fetch all web hook definitions. No input parameters are required. No specific privilege is required beyond a valid user session or API Key.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this will include a `rows` array containing all web hooks, and a `list` object containing list metadata (e.g. `length` for total rows without pagination).

Example response:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": "example_hook",
      "title": "Example Hook",
      "enabled": true,
      "url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": [
        { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
        { "name": "User-Agent", "value": "xyOps/WebHook" }
      ],

      "created": 1754365754,
      "revision": 2
    }
  ],
  "list": { "length": 1 }
}
```

See [WebHook](data.md#webhook) for details on web hook properties.

### get_web_hook

```
GET /api/app/get_web_hook/v1
```

See [WebHook](data.md#webhook) for property details. The `id` may be omitted and will be auto-generated; `username`, `created`, `modified`, and `revision` are set by the server.

Notes:

- The server validates `id` (alphanumeric/underscore), `method` (letters only), and `url` (must be `http` or `https`).
- If `body` is provided, any `{{ ... }}` templates are precompiled and a syntax error returns an error response.
- Web hooks can expand secrets at runtime when allowed via [Secret.web_hooks](data.md#secret-web_hooks).

Example request:

```json
{
  "title": "Example Hook",
  "enabled": true,
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post",

}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this includes a `web_hook` object containing the newly created web hook.

### update_web_hook

```
POST /api/app/update_web_hook/v1
```

Update an existing web hook by ID. Requires the [edit_web_hooks](privileges.md#edit_web_hooks) privilege, plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON. The request is shallow-merged into the existing web hook, so you can provide a sparse set of properties to update. The server updates `modified` and increments `revision` automatically.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** The web hook ID to update. |
| (Other) | Various | Any updatable [WebHook](data.md#webhook) fields (e.g. `title`, `enabled`, `url`, `method`, `headers`, `body`, `timeout`, `retries`, `follow`, `ssl_cert_bypass`, `max_per_day`, `notes`, `icon`). |

Notes:

- If `body` is provided, templates are precompiled; syntax errors result in an error response.

Example request:

```json
{
  "id": "example_hook",
  "title": "Example Hook (updated)",
  "timeout": 60,
  "follow": true
}
```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

### delete_web_hook

```
POST /api/app/delete_web_hook/v1

Example request:

```json
{ "id": "example_hook" }
```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

Deletions are permanent and cannot be undone.

### test_web_hook

```
POST /api/app/test_web_hook/v1
```

Test a web hook configuration by performing a live HTTP request and returning a detailed, markdown-formatted report. Requires the [edit_web_hooks](privileges.md#edit_web_hooks) privilege, plus a valid user session or API Key. Send as HTTP POST with JSON.

Behavior:

- If the provided `id` matches an existing web hook, the server merges it with the request body, allowing you to override fields for testing without saving them.
- Templates in `url`, `headers[].value`, and `body` are expanded using the same data as runtime actions. When testing an existing, saved hook, secrets are included if granted via [Secret.web_hooks](data.md#secret-web_hooks).
- Timeouts, retries, redirect behavior (`follow`), and TLS validation (`ssl_cert_bypass`) are honored during the test.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | **(Required)** Web hook ID to test (existing hook is optional, but an ID is required). |
| `title` | String | **(Required)** A title for the test. Required even when testing an existing hook. |
| `method` | String | **(Required)** HTTP method to use (e.g., `GET`, `POST`). |
| `url` | String | **(Required)** Fully-qualified `http` or `https` URL to call. |
| (Other) | Various | Any [WebHook](data.md#webhook) fields to apply for this test only (e.g., `headers`, `body`, `timeout`, `retries`, `follow`, `ssl_cert_bypass`). |

Example request (override headers and timeout for an existing hook):

```json
{
  "id": "example_hook",
  "title": "Example Hook",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
  "headers": [ { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" } ],
  "body": "{\n  \"text\": \"Hello from test\"\n}",
  "timeout": 10
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "result": {
    "code": 0,
    "description": "Success (HTTP 200 OK)",
    "details": "- **Method:** POST\n- **URL:** https://httpbin.org/post\n\n**Response:** HTTP 200 OK\n\n..."
  }
}
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this includes a `result` object with:

- `code`: `0` on success, or a string error code (e.g., `"webhook"`).
- `description`: Short summary text (e.g., HTTP status).
- `details`: A markdown-formatted report including request/response headers and body, and performance metrics when available.

This API accepts a single `duration` parameter, which can be set to a custom amount of seconds.

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

The test job appears in the Internal Jobs panel and completes automatically.

### bulk_search_delete_jobs

```
POST /api/app/bulk_search_delete_jobs/v1

```

### admin_run_optimization

```
POST /api/app/admin_run_optimization/v1
```

Run a SQLite database integrity check and compaction (VACUUM). Admin only. Only applicable if SQLite is being used in the storage backend.  If the current storage engine is not SQLite or no database file is present, this returns an error.

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

### admin_reset_daily_stats

```
POST /api/app/admin_reset_daily_stats/v1
```

Reset daily statistics counters (dashboard day graphs). Admin only. This also pushes the current stats snapshot into historical storage and broadcasts refreshed stats to connected users.

Parameters: Same payload you would pass to [admin_export_data](#admin_export_data) (e.g., `lists`, `indexes`, `extras`, or `items`). The token binds to your session and the provided parameters.

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0, "token": "tme4wxyz9ab" }
```

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this returns a `token` string to include in a follow-up GET.

### admin_stats

```
GET /api/app/admin_stats/v1
```

Return extended system statistics for the System Status page. Admin only.

No input parameters.

In addition to the [Standard Response Format](#standard-response-format), this returns a `stats` object including:

- `version`: xyOps version.
- `node.version`: Node.js version.
- `db.sqlite`: Total on-disk bytes for SQLite DB + WAL (if present).
- `db.records`: Map of index ID → row count (e.g., `jobs`, `servers`, `snapshots`, `alerts`, `activity`).
- `unbase`: Low-level indexer statistics.
- `cache`: Storage cache stats (if enabled).
- `sockets`: Connected user and server sockets with metadata (ID, IP, type, username, server, ping).

Example response:

```json

```

### admin_import_data

```
POST /api/app/admin_import_data/v1
```

Bulk import data from a local archive file. Send as `multipart/form-data` with a single file field. Admin only. The file may be plain text or gzip-compressed. The import runs as an internal job; the API responds early with the job ID.

Parameters (multipart/form-data fields):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `file` | File | **(Required)** NDJSON file to import (may be `.gz`). The field name may be arbitrary; only one file should be included. |
| `format` | String | Optional. `xyops` (default) or `cronicle`. When `cronicle`, the server will convert known structures before importing. |

NDJSON line formats supported:

- `{ "index": INDEX, "id": ID, "record": { ... } }` to upsert a DB record.
- `{ "key": KEY, "value": VALUE }` to write a storage key (binary values are base64-encoded).
- `{ "cmd": CMD, "args": [ ... ] }` to execute a storage command (e.g., `listDelete`).

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0, "id": "ijobabc123" }
```

Notes:

- The scheduler is automatically paused for the import, all queued jobs are flushed, and running jobs are aborted prior to import for data integrity.
- A detailed report is attached to the internal job and emailed to the user who issued the request.
- After import, global lists are reloaded, monitors/alerts are recompiled, and the UI is refreshed for connected users.

### admin_export_data

```
GET /api/app/admin_export_data/v1
```

Stream a gzip-compressed NDJSON archive of selected data to the client. Admin only. For browser downloads, first call [get_transfer_token](#get_transfer_token) and then include `?token=...` on this GET to authorize and apply the parameters pre-bound to the token.

Parameters (choose either the high-level selectors or a custom `items` array):

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `lists` | Array<String> or String | List IDs from `config.ui.list_list` or the literal string `"all"`. Each exports the corresponding `global/NAME` list and pages. |
| `indexes` | Array<String> or String | Database index IDs from `config.ui.database_list` or `"all"`. Exports matching DB records (newest to oldest). |
| `extras` | Array<String> or String | Optional extras or `"all"`. Supported: `user_avatars`, `job_files`, `job_logs`, `monitor_data`, `stat_data`. |
| `items` | Array<Object> | Advanced mode. Array of export items such as `{ type: "list", key }`, `{ type: "index", index, query?, max_rows? }`, `{ type: "users", avatars? }`, `{ type: "jobFiles", query?, max_rows?, max_size?, logs?, files? }`, `{ type: "monitorData", query? }`, `{ type: "bucketData" }`, `{ type: "bucketFiles", max_size? }`, `{ type: "secretData" }`. |
| `token` | String | Single-use token from [get_transfer_token](#get_transfer_token). When present, parameters from the token are applied and the token is invalidated. |

Response: A `200 OK` streaming gzip file. The content is NDJSON containing a mix of:

- `{ "index": INDEX, "id": ID, "record": { ... } }` for DB records.
- `{ "key": KEY, "value": VALUE }` for storage keys or files (binary values are base64-encoded).

Notes:

- Job logs/files are exported only if under 1 MB each.
- Bucket files are exported as base64 with a manifest of file metadata.
- Secret data is exported as encrypted values (as stored).

### admin_delete_data

```
POST /api/app/admin_delete_data/v1
```

Permanently delete selected data in bulk. Admin only. Runs as an internal job and compiles a report with counts and any errors/warnings.

Parameters:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `items` | Array<Object> | **(Required)** Array of delete actions. Supported types: `{ type: "list", key }`, `{ type: "index", index, query? }`, `{ type: "users" }`, `{ type: "bucketData" }`, `{ type: "bucketFiles" }`, `{ type: "secretData" }`. |

Example request:

```json
{ "items": [ { "type": "users" }, { "type": "list", "key": "global/stats" }, { "type": "index", "index": "jobs" } ] }
```

Example response:

```json
{ "code": 0 }
```

Notes:

- Consider stopping or pausing jobs before deletion. The scheduler is not automatically paused for deletions.
- Some types perform deep cleanup first (e.g., `users` removes avatars and security logs; bucket delete types remove data and files before the `global/buckets` list is altered).

### admin_logout_all

```
POST /api/app/admin_logout_all/v1
```

Log out all active sessions for a specific user and deauthorize any connected sockets. Admin only. Executes as an internal job; returns immediately.
