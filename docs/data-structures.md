# Overview

This document details all of the data structures used in xyOps.

# Alert

An alert definition is a trigger that specifies conditions under which the alert should fire, and what actions should take place.  The alert expression can use any server data values to determine when to fire, for e.g. `cpu.currentLoad > 80`.  Here is an example alert in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "load_avg_high",
	"title": "High CPU Load",
	"expression": "monitors.load_avg >= (cpu.cores + 1)",
	"message": "CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)",
	"groups": [],
	"email": "",
	"web_hook": "",
	"monitor_id": "load_avg",
	"enabled": true,
	"samples": 1,
	"notes": "",
	"username": "admin",
	"modified": 1434125333,
	"created": 1434125333
}
```

## Alert.id

A unique alphanumeric ID for the alert.

## Alert.title

A visual title for the alert, displayed in the UI, and in notifications.

## Alert.enabled

A boolean flag indicating if the alert is enabled or not.

## Alert.icon

An optional icon ID for the alert, displayed in the UI.  Icons are sourced from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

## Alert.expression

The expression that defines the conditions under which the alert should fire.  This can use any server data values, for example: `cpu.currentLoad > 80`.  The format of the expression is JavaScript.

## Alert.message

The message to include in the alert notification. This can include mustache placeholders for inserting dynamic content.  Example: `CPU load average is too high: {{float(monitors.load_avg)}} ({{cpu.cores}} CPU cores)`.  See [Monitoring](monitors.md) for more on this syntax.

## Alert.groups

The server groups where the alert is active.  Leave blank to apply to all groups.

## Alert.actions

A set of [Actions](#action) to perform when the alert fires and/or clears.  This list may be augmented by the server group as well.

## Alert.monitor_id

Optionally link the alert to a monitor given its [ID](#monitor-id).  This will show the alert tag on top of the specified monitor graph.

## Alert.samples

The number of consecutive times the expression must evaluate to `true` before the alert fires.  Similarly, this is also the alert "cooldown" (the expression must evaluate to `false` the same number of times before the alert is considered inactive).

## Alert.notes

Optional notes or comments about the alert.

## Alert.username

The user or API Key who created the alert.
	
## Alert.modified

The Unix timestamp when the alert was last modified.

## Alert.created

The Unix timestamp when the alert was created.

## Alert.revision

An internal revision number for the alert, incremented with each change.

# APIKey

## Category.limits

An array of [Limit](#limit) items to apply to running jobs, e.g. CPU and memory limits.  In the UI these are referred to as "Resource Limits".  These are automatically applied to all events assigned to the category as defaults.  Events may define additional limits *or override category limits* (matched by type).

# Channel

A notification channel is a way to send notifications to a group of users, and trigger other system actions such as web hooks, when certain event actions occur.  Here is an example channel in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "sev1",

## Channel.sound

An optional sound effect to play to all subscribed users when the channel is triggered.  This should be a filename with a `.mp3` file extension.  See [Sound Effects](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/htdocs/sounds/) for the list of available sound effects to choose from.

## Channel.max_per_day

An optional maximum number of times the channel can be triggered per day.

## Channel.notes

Optional notes or comments about the channel.

## Channel.revision

An internal revision number for the channel, incremented with each change.

# Event

An event is an item on the schedule which launches [Jobs](#job).  It may or may not be scheduled to run at specific times (i.e. it may be on-demand only).  Here is an example event in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "event100",

				6
			]
		}
	],
	"icon": "",
	"tags": [
		"important"
	],
	"algo": "random"
}
```

Events have the following properties:

## Event.id

A unique alphanumeric ID for the event.

## Event.title

A visual title for the event, displayed in the UI.

## Event.enabled

A boolean flag indicating if the event is enabled (can run jobs) or disabled.

## Event.icon

An optional icon ID for the event, displayed in the UI.  Icons are sourced from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

## Event.category

The [Category.id](#category-id) of the category to which the event belongs.

## Event.plugin

The [Plugin.id](#plugin-id) of the plugin which will handle running jobs.

## Event.params

An object containing key/value pairs which is passed to the job process.  These are typically defined by the [Plugin](#plugin) and populated in the UI.

## Event.fields

An optional array of user-defined parameter definitions that are collected when a job is started manually in the UI, and then the values are merged into the [Event.params](#event-params) object.

See [Plugin.params](#plugin-params) for details on the format of the objects in this array.

## Event.tags

An array of [Tag](#tag) IDs which can be used to search for historical jobs.  The running job may also modify this list.

## Event.targets

An array of server or group targets to run the event.  Each item of the array is a string, and can can either be a [Server.id](#server-id) or a [Group.id](#group-id).

## Event.algo

When multiple servers are in the [Event.targets](#event-targets) array, xyOps uses a select algorithm to select a server to run the job.  The available algorithms are:

| Algorithm | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `random` | Randomly pick a server from the list. |
| `round_robin` | Pick each server in sequence, then repeat. |
| `least_cpu` | Pick the server with the least CPU usage. |
| `least_mem` | Pick the server with the least memory usage. |
| `prefer_first` | Prefer the first server when alphabetically sorted by hostname. |
| `prefer_last` | Prefer the last server when alphabetically sorted by hostname. |

## Event.notes

Optional notes for the event, which are included in email notifications for event actions.

## Event.actions

An array of [Action](#action) items to invoke at various points during job runs.

The event's [Category](#category) can define additional actions which are appended to this list at job run time.

## Event.limits

An array of [Limit](#limit) items to apply to running jobs, e.g. CPU and memory limits.  In the UI these are referred to as "Resource Limits".

The event's [Category](#category) can define limits which act as defaults to the event limits.

## Event.triggers

An array of [Trigger](#trigger) items to schedule future job runs and set rules, e.g. blackout dates.

## Event.workflow

If the event is a workflow, this contains detailed information about the nodes and connections.  See the [Workflow](#workflow) section for details.

## Event.revision

An internal revision number for the event, incremented with each change.

# Group

A server group is a collection of servers, usually auto-matched by hostname, but you can also manually assign servers to groups.  Here is an example group in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "main",
	"title": "Main Group",
	"hostname_match": ".+",
	"sort_order": 0,
	"username": "admin",
	"modified": 1754365754,

## Group.alert_actions

A set of [Actions](#action) to perform when **any** alert fires and/or clears on a server in the group.

## Group.notes

Optional notes for the group, which are included in email notifications for group actions.

## Group.revision

An internal revision number for the group, incremented with each change.

## Group.sort_order

An integer value representing the sort order of the group.  Lower values are sorted first.

# Job

A job is a running (or previously ran) instance of an event.  The job structure has nearly all the same properties as [Event](#event) with these differences:

| Property Name | Note |
|---------------|--------|
| `id` | Replaced with [Job.id](#job-id). |
| `event` | The [Event.id](#event-id]) of the event which spawned the job. |
| `title` | Removed from job structure when event is copied. |
| `enabled` | Removed from job structure when event is copied. |
| `created` | Removed from job structure when event is copied. |
| `modified` | Removed from job structure when event is copied. |
| `triggers` | Removed from job structure when event is copied. |

And these additions:

## Job.id

An auto-generated, unique, alphanumeric ID for the job, which will always start with a `j`.

## Job.type

An optional string representing a custom job type.  Values include:

| Job Type | Note | 
|----------|------|
| `workflow` | Job is a top-level workflow control job, which will spawn sub-jobs. | 
| `adhoc` | Job is running as an ad-hoc under a workflow, with no event attached. | 

## Job.event

The [Event.id](#event-id) of the event which spawned the job.

## Job.server

Which [Server.id](#server-id) that was chosen to run the job, based on the [Event.algo](#event-algo).

## Job.groups

When a server is chosen, that server's assigned groups are copied into the job.

## Job.command

Which executable to run for the job.  This cannot be set -- it is copied from the [Plugin](#plugin).

## Job.uid

Which UID (User ID) to run the job process as.  This cannot be set -- it is copied from the [Plugin](#plugin).

## Job.cwd

Which CWD (Current Working Directory) run the job process under.  This cannot be set -- it is copied from the [Plugin](#plugin).

## Job.env

Custom job environment variables to inject into the executable when spawning it.  If unset, this is copied from the `job_env` master configuration property.

## Job.state

Specifies which state the job is currently in.  Here is a list of all the possible states:

| Job State | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `queued` | Job is queued and waiting for an open slot to move to `ready` state. |
| `start_delay` | Job has a custom starting delay.  The timestamp at which the delay expires should be in [Job.until](#job-until). |
| `retry_delay` | Job is currently in a retry delay.  The timestamp at which the delay expires should be in [Job.until](#job-until). |
| `ready` | Job is ready to start. |
| `active` | Job is currently active (running). |
| `finishing` | Job is finishing (uploading logs and/or files). |
| `complete` | Job is complete. |

## Job.started

The timestamp at which the job was started (Unix seconds).  Specifically this is when the job was moved to a `ready` state.

## Job.updated

The timestamp at which the job was last updated (Unix seconds).

## Job.completed

The timestamp at which the job was completed (Unix seconds).

## Job.elapsed

The duration of the job run in seconds (calculated as the difference between [Job.started](#job-started) and [Job.completed](#job-completed)).  This does not include time spent in queue or start delay.

## Job.now

The job's "now" time, as an Unix timestamp, which is the time at which the job was originally scheduled to launch.  This timestamp may be in the past if the job is running as part of a catch-up operation.

## Job.code

When a job completes, the `code` denotes the result.  Zero (`0`) means success, any other value means the job failed.  You can use this to specify your own internal error code, or just specify `1` for a generic error.  Any number or string is acceptable.  There are a few special values that xyOps recognizes:

| Job Code | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `warning` | This denotes that a job failed by only with a "warning", not a full error. |
| `critical` | This denotes that the job failed critically, and needs immediate attention. |
| `abort` | This denotes that the job was manually aborted, either by a user or an API call. |

## Job.description

When a job fails, the `description` property can contain a summary of the error message.

## Job.remote

Set to `true` when the job has an active remote server connection (job request was sent to remote server).

## Job.until

Specifies the timestamp at which point the job can be moved into a ready state.  This property is used by the `start_delay` and `retry_delay` states.

## Job.progress

User-populated progress indicator, should be a floating point number between `0.0` to `1.0`.  Both extremes (`0.0` and `1.0`) display as "indeterminate" in the UI.

## Job.reconnected

A Unix timestamp of when the primary server socket was reconnected, during a job run.  The presence of this property indicates that the worker server lost its connection to the primary during the job, and then reconnected later.

## Job.log_file

An optional log file for the user to write/append to, during a job.  This is a legacy carryover from Cronicle.  If present at the completion of a job, the file will be uploaded as an attachment.

## Job.log_file_size

The size of the actual job output, in bytes, and updated continuously as job runs.  This is the STDOUT and STDERR captured from the job process, and is not associated with the legacy [Job.log_file](#job-log_file) property.

## Job.activity

An array of meta log entries for the job.

## Job.source

A string ID indicating what spawned the job.  This will be one of:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scheduler` | Job was spawned normally via the scheduler. |
| `plugin` | Job was spawned from a Scheduler Plugin. |
| `key` | Job was spawned via a HTTP request to the `run_event` API using an API Key.  There will be an additional property named `key` containing the internal API Key ID (non-secret). |
| `user` | Job was spawned manually via user request in the UI.  There will be an additional property named `username` containing the username of the user who initiated the action. |
| `action` | Job was spawned by a custom job action (i.e. start, complete, success or fail action condition).  [Job.parent](#job-parent) will also be present in this case. |
| `alert` | Job was spawned by an alert notification from the server monitoring system. |
| `workflow` | Job was spawned as part of a workflow sequence. |

## Job.parent

When the job was launched from another job (custom action or workflow step), this will contain information about the parent job which spawned the current job.  It will be an object with the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `job` | String | The [Job.id](#job-id) of the job which launched the current job. |
| `event` | String | The [Event.id](#event-id) of the job which launched the current job. |
| `code` | Mixed | The [Job.code](#job-code) of the job which launched the current job. |
| `description` | String | The [Job.description](#job-description) of the job which launched the current job. |

## Job.input

When another job passes data or files to the current job, an `input` object is populated.  The object may have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `data` | Object | A user-defined object containing arbitrary data for the job. |
| `files` | Array | An array of files supplied to the job, from a previous job, storage bucket, or trigger plugin |

The format of the `data` object is freeform, and completely user-defined.  The `files` array will be formatted the same as [Job.files](#job-files).

## Job.retried

Boolean, will be set to `true` when a job was retried, and another job exists in the same set.

## Job.retry_count

For retried jobs, a retry counter is present that counts upwards for each new retry.  It will not exceed the retry [limit](#limit) set in the event.

## Job.retry_prev

When a job is a retry, this property will contain the [Job.id](#job-id) of the previous attempt.

## Job.jobs

When a job launches other jobs, either by retry or action condition, the newly launched jobs will be added to a `jobs` array in the parent (source) job.  Each item in the array is an object with `id` and `reason` properties.  The reason can be one of `action` or `retry`.

## Job.cpu

This will contain information about the job process CPU usage.

## Job.mem

This will contain information about the job process memory usage.

## Job.disk

This will contain information about the job process disk usage.

## Job.net

This will contain information about the job process network usage (open TCP connections).

## Job.data

This is a place where the job can store arbitrary data, which will be passed to the next job (if part of a workflow, or launched via an action).

## Job.files

This will contain information about all uploaded files for the job.  While the job is running, the user can populate this array to attach files for the job.  Each item in the array can be a simple string (file path or glob), a sub-array of file path and filename, a sub-array of file path, filename, and a `true` boolean to delete the file after uploading, or an object with the following properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `path` | Path to the file on disk, or a glob matching multiple files. |
| `filename` | Custom destination filename to use when uploading.  Do not combine with a glob path. |
| `delete` | Set this to `true` to delete the file(s) after uploading. |

Once the job is complete, the files will be uploaded and the array will be recreated as an array of objects, one per file, with each object following the [File](#file) structure.

## Job.update_event

This allows the user job code to update the event at time of completion.  For example, here is how you would disable the event:

```sh
echo '{ "xy":true, "update_event": { "enabled": false } }'
```

## Job.push

A system by which the user code can push new [actions](#action) and [limits](#limit) onto the job while it is still running.  For example:

```sh
echo '{ "xy":true, "push": { "actions": [ { "condition":"success", "type":"email", "email":"you@yourdomain.com" } ] } }'
```

## Job.procs

An array of process IDs (PIDs) and additional process information that are associated with the job.

## Job.conns

An array of network connections (TCP/UDP) and additional metadata that are associated with the job.

## Job.timelines

An array of timeline events that occurred during the job's execution.  This data is used to plot the CPU/Mem/Disk/Net graphs for the job.

## Job.table

User writable property for providing a table of data.  Should be specified as an object with `title`, `rows`, `cols` and `caption` properties.  The `title` and `caption` may be omitted.

## Job.html

User writable property for providing a HTML-formatted report.  Should be specified as an object with `title`, `content` and `caption` properties.  The `title` and `caption` may be omitted.

## Job.markdown

User writable property for providing a markdown-formatted report.  Should be specified as an object with `title`, `content` and `caption` properties.  The `title` and `caption` may be omitted.  This gets converted to HTML on the back-end.

## Job.text

User writable property for providing a text-formatted report.  Should be specified as an object with `title`, `content` and `caption` properties.  The `title` and `caption` may be omitted.  This gets converted to HTML using a `<pre>` element.

## Job.stype

This is set to a string when a job is launched via a special scheduler trigger like "single" (single-shot) or "interval".  Only used for UI hinting.

## Job.splugin

This is set to a Plugin ID by the scheduler when a job was launched from a Plugin based trigger configuration.  Only used for UI hinting.

## Job.label

User writable property for providing a visual label for the Job.  Should be specified as a string, and will be displayed alongside the Job ID on completion screens and history lists.

## Job.test

This is set to `true` when the job was fired from an event test.  This is used to override the event enabled check, and add hints to the UI.

## Job.workflow

When the job is itself a workflow, or a sub-job inside a workflow, this object will contain additional information.  See [JobWorkflow](#jobworkflow) for details.

# Monitor

A monitor keeps track on a specific numeric server metric.  These are graphed in the UI so you can see trends over time, and you can also point alerts at them.  Here is an example monitor in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "cpu_usage",
	"title": "CPU Usage %",
	"source": "cpu.currentLoad",
	"data_type": "float",
	"suffix": "%",
	"groups": [],
	"display": true,
	"min_vert_scale": 100,
	"sort_order": 1,
	"username": "admin",
	"modified": 1754365754,
	"created": 1754365754,
	"revision": 1
}
```

## Monitor.id

A unique alphanumeric ID for the monitor.

## Monitor.title

A visual title for the monitor, displayed in the UI.

## Monitor.display

A boolean flag indicating if the monitor is displayed in the UI or not.

## Monitor.icon

An optional icon ID for the monitor, displayed in the UI.  Icons are sourced from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

## Monitor.groups

An array of server group IDs that the monitor will keep track of.

## Monitor.source

An expression that points to the data source for the monitor's value.  This can point to any server data value, for example: `cpu.currentLoad`.  The format of the expression is JavaScript.

## Monitor.data_match

If the monitor source points at a text string, you can supply a regular expression in this field to pull out a single numerical data value from the text.  This is commonly used with custom commands (Monitor Plugins).

## Monitor.data_type

The data type of the monitor's value.  This can be one of: `integer`, `float`, `bytes`, `seconds`, or `milliseconds`.

## Monitor.min_vert_scale

This allows you to set the minimum vertical scale (range) in the visual charts for the monitor.  For example, monitors that show a percentage (i.e. CPU usage) might want a minimum vertical scale of `100`.

## Monitor.suffix

Optionally show a suffix for the monitor's value.  This can be useful for indicating units (e.g. `%`, `MB`, `ms`, etc.).

## Monitor.delta

When set to true, this will treat the monitor's value as a delta (i.e. the change in value over time) rather than an absolute value.  This is useful for server metrics that are measured as absolute counters, such as Linux network traffic or disk I/O.

## Monitor.divide_by_delta

When set, this will divide the monitor's value by the time duration between samples before displaying it.  This is useful for converting absolute values into rates (e.g. bytes per second).

## Monitor.delta_min_value

When set, this will specify the minimum value for the monitor's computed delta. This is useful for preventing a delta monitor from showing a huge negative spike due to a brief drop in the absolute monitored value (such as when a server is rebooted, or resets its absolute counter).

This should be set to `false` for disabled, or a any valid number to enable it, including `0`.

## Monitor.notes

Optional notes or comments about the monitor's purpose or configuration.

## Monitor.revision

An internal revision number for the monitor, incremented with each change.

## Monitor.sort_order

An integer value representing the sort order of the monitor.  Lower values are sorted first.

## Plugin.params

A set of custom parameters to pass to the plugin when it is executed (for non-monitor Plugins only).  These are the parameter definitions, which users then populate in the UI when setting up events / workflows.  Each item in the `params` array should be an object with the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | A lower-case alphanumeric ID for the parameter (can also contain underscores). |
| `title` | String | A visual title for the parameter, displayed in the UI. |

## Plugin.gid

This is the GID (group account) to run the plugin under.  The GID may be either numerical or a string ('wheel', 'admin', etc.).

## Plugin.kill

This string specifies how xySat should terminate processes when a job is aborted.  This is only used for Event Plugins.  The accepted values are as follows:

- `none` means that **no** processes are killed on abort.  This is only used for very special cases.
- `parent` means that only the **parent** process is killed on abort.  This is the default behavior for new Plugins.
- `all` means that **all** processes are killed on abort.  Meaning, xySat will traverse the process tree from the parent process down, and kill everything.

When the specified action occurs, the web hook sends a HTTP request to the specified URL with an optional payload containing information about the event. Web hooks are commonly used for real-time notifications, integrations with other services, and automating workflows.  Here is an example Web Hook in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "example_hook",
	"title": "Example Hook",
	"enabled": true,
	"url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
	"method": "POST",
	"headers": [
		{
			"name": "Content-Type",
			"value": "application/json"
		},
		{
			"name": "User-Agent",
			"value": "OpsRocket/WebHook"
		}
	],
	"body": "{\n\t\"text\": \"{{text}}\",\n\t\"content\": \"{{text}}\",\n\t\"message\": \"{{text}}\"\n}",
	"timeout": 30,
	"retries": 0,
	"follow": false,
	"ssl_cert_bypass": false,
	"notes": "An example web hook for demonstration purposes.",
	"icon": "",
	"username": "admin",
	"modified": 1754449105,
	"created": 1754365754,
	"revision": 2,
	"max_per_day": 0
}
```

## WebHook.id

The unique identifier for the web hook.

## WebHook.title

The title of the web hook.

## WebHook.enabled

A boolean indicating whether the web hook is enabled or disabled.

## WebHook.icon

An optional icon ID for the web hook, displayed in the UI.  Icons are sourced from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

## WebHook.url

The URL to which the web hook will send its request.

## WebHook.method

The HTTP method to use when sending the request. Common methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

## WebHook.headers

An optional list of HTTP headers to include in the request.  This is formatted as an array of objects, where each object has a `name` and `value` property.

## WebHook.body

The optional body of the request to send with the web hook.  This is typically a JSON string, and may include placeholders (e.g. `{{text}}`) that will be replaced with actual values when the web hook is triggered.

## WebHook.timeout

The maximum time to wait for a response from the web hook before timing out. This is specified in seconds.

## WebHook.retries

The number of times to retry the web hook request if it fails. This is specified as an integer.

## WebHook.follow

A boolean indicating whether to follow redirects for the web hook request.

## WebHook.ssl_cert_bypass

A boolean indicating whether to bypass SSL certificate verification for the web hook request.

## WebHook.max_per_day

The maximum number of times the web hook can be triggered in a single day (i.e. anti-flood). This is specified as an integer.

## WebHook.notes

An optional field for adding notes or comments about the web hook.

## WebHook.revision

An internal revision number for the web hook, used for tracking changes.

# Activity

When user or system actions are logged, an activity item is created and indexed in the DB for searchability.  Here is an example in JSON format:

```json
{
    "action": "ticket_create",
    "description": "tmg7023diyu",
    "epoch": 1759263488,
    "headers": {
        "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; ... Safari/605.1.15"
    },
    "id": "amg7023dtyv",
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "ips": [
        "127.0.0.1"
    ],
    "keywords": [
        "tmg7023diyu",
        "admin",
        "127.0.0.1"
    ],
    "ticket": {
        "assignee": "admin",
        "body": "This ticket was created to discuss job `#jmfftq09eqz` (**Monitored value-added protocol**).\n",
        "category": "cat1",
        "cc": [],
        "created": 1759263488,
        "due": 0,

        "tags": [
            "flag"
        ],
        "type": "issue",
        "username": "admin"
    },
    "username": "admin"
}

# Master

xyOps keep track of all online master (backup) servers in the cluster, using the following in-memory data structure (displayed as JSON):

```json
{
	"id": "joemax.lan",
	"online": true,
	"master": true,
	"date": 1762816958,
	"version": "1.0",
	"ping": 0,
	"stats": { 
		"mem": 134217728, 
		"load": 0.02
	}
}
```

## Master.id

This is the master server's internal ID, which is usually it's hostname.

## Master.online

A boolean indicating whether the server is online (connected) or not.

## Master.master

A boolean indicating whether the server is the current master primary or not.

## Master.date

A timestamp in Unix seconds representing when the server came online.

## Master.version

Currently unused, will always be set to "1.0".  For future use.

## Master.ping

The last ping time (in milliseconds) between the current master and the server (Websocket RTT).

## Master.stats

This object will contain basic stats about the server, including `mem` (current memory usage of the xyOps process), and `load` (minute load average).

# State

xyOps keeps state data in a `global/state` storage record.  This is so it can survive restarts, and survive master failover to a backup server.  It is used to store things like the scheduler master switch, event state (time cursors), and server/group watches (snapshots).

## State.scheduler

The `scheduler` object contains properties specific to the job scheduler subsystem.  Namely an `enabled` boolean, which will be `true` if the scheduler is active and running jobs, or `false` if it is paused.

## State.events

The `events` object holds state information about all events, namely their cursor for [Catch-Up](events.md#catch-up) mode, and information about previously completed jobs.  Here are the properties stored per event, each in `events.EVENTID.`:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `cursor` | Number | For [Catch-Up](events.md#catch-up) events, this contains the event's current timestamp, which is used to run all missed jobs during an outage window. |
| `last_code` | Mixed | The [Job.code](#job-code) from the last completed job, if any. |
| `last_job` | String | The [Job.id](#job-id) of the last completed job, if any. |
| `total_elapsed` | Number | The total job elapsed time across all completed jobs (used to compute average). |
| `total_count` | Number | Total completed jobs on record.  The `total_elapsed` is divided by this number to get an average job elapsed time for the event. |

## State.watches

xyOps keeps track of server and group watches (automatic monitoring snapshots) in this object.  The data layout is as follows:

- Server watches are stored in `watches.servers.SERVERID`.
- Group watches are stored in `watches.groups.GROUPID`.

The property values are Unix seconds, set to when the watch should end.  Example in JSON format:

```json
{
	"watches": {
		"servers": {
			"smgqzr4dtgw": 1762050600,
			"jmgs89hkdrv": 1962050600
		},
		"groups": {
			"gmhl194nsw8": 1862050600
		}
	}
}
```

## State.next_ticket_num

This property holds the next available [Ticket.num](#ticket-num), which is applied and incremented when a new ticket is created.

# Sub-Objects

These objects are nested under other data structures, usually items of an array.

## Action

Actions can be assigned to job related events such as start, completion, errors, and other conditions.  Here is an example:

```json
{
	"enabled": true,
	"condition": "error",
	"type": "email",
	"email": "admin@myserver.com"
}
```

This action would fire when the job resulted in an error, and it would send an email to `admin@myserver.com`, notifying them about the event.

Each action object should have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Boolean | Specifies whether the action is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). |
| `condition` | String | Specifies the condition which runs the action.  See [Action Conditions](#action-conditions) below. |
| `type` | String | Specifies which action will take place when the condition fires.  See [Action Types](#action-types) below. |

Additional properties may be present based on the type.

### Action Conditions

Each action has a `condition` property which specifies when it will fire.  The value may be one of:

| Condition ID | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `start` | Fires on job start. |
| `complete` | Fires on job completion, regardless of the outcome. |
| `success` | Fires on job success, i.e. when the `code` property is `0` or `false`. |
| `error` | Fires on job errors, i.e. when the `code` property is any true value or string. |
| `warning` | Fires on job warnings, i.e. when the `code` property is set to `"warning"`. |
| `critical` | Fires on critical errors, i.e. when the `code` property is set to `"critical"`. |
| `abort` | Fires when the job is aborted, either by user or special event (e.g. lost server). |

### Action Types

Each action has a `type` property which dictates what will happen when the condition fires.  The different types are listed below:

| Type ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `email` | Send email to one or more addresses.  The addresses should be in an extra property named `email` (comma-separated). |
| `web_hook` | Fire off a web hook (HTTP POST) for the action.  The URL should be specified in a property named `url`. |
| `run_event` | Run a custom job for the action.  The Event ID should be specified in a property named `event_id`. |
| `channel` | Activate a notification channel for the action.  The Channel ID should be specified in a property named `channel_id`. |
| `disable` | Disable the event for the action (no extra properties defined). |
| `snapshot` | Take a server snapshot for the action (no extra properties defined). |

## Limit

Limits (otherwise known as "Resource Limits" in the UI) govern things like CPU, memory, and log size for running jobs.  They can be assigned to both events and categories, and each may have several different limits set.  Here is an example:

```json
{
	"type": "time",
	"enabled": true,
	"duration": 3600
}
```

This would set a time limit of 3600 seconds (1 hour) for running jobs.

Each limit object should have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Boolean | Specifies whether the limit is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). |
| `type` | String | Specifies the type of limit.  See [Limit Types](#limit-types) below. |

Additional properties may be present based on the type.

When limits are assigned to categories, they act as defaults for events in that category.  Events may still override limits set in their categories.

### Limit Types

Each limit has a `type` property which specifies what it governs.  The different types are described below:

| Type ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `time` | Set a maximum run time for jobs.  The limit should be in a property named `duration`, specified as seconds. |
| `job` | Set a maximum number of concurrent jobs for the event.  The number should be a in property named `amount`. |
| `log` | Set a maximum limit on the log file size for jobs.  The limit should be in a property named `amount`, specified as bytes. |
| `mem` | Set a maximum limit for memory usage for jobs (includes all child processes).  The limit should be in a property named `amount`, specified as bytes.  The sustain duration should be in a property named `duration`, specified as seconds. |
| `cpu` | Set a maximum limit for CPU usage for jobs (includes all child processes).  The limit should be in a property named `amount`, specified as a percentage of one CPU core.  The sustain duration should be in a property named `duration`, specified as seconds. |
| `retry` | Set a maximum number of retries allowed for failed jobs.  The number of retries should be in a property named `amount`, and optionally the delay between retries should be in a property named `duration`, specified as seconds. |
| `queue` | Set a maximum number of jobs that may be queued up, if other limits prevent them from running concurrently.  The number should be in a property named `amount`. |

## Trigger

Events are scheduled using one or more trigger objects, which can define repeating invocations (hourly, daily, etc.), single-shots on an exact future date/time, and other misc. rules such as blackout dates.  Here is an example:

```json
{
	"type": "schedule",
	"enabled": true,
	"hours": [ 4 ],
	"minutes": [ 30 ]
}
```

This would run every day at 4:30 AM (repeating).

Each trigger object should have the following properties:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Boolean | Specifies whether the trigger is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). |
| `type` | String | Specifies the type of trigger.  See [Trigger Types](#trigger-types) below. |

Additional properties may be present based on the type.

### Trigger Types

Each trigger has a `type` property which describes its behavior.  The different types are listed below:

| Type ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `schedule` | Set a repeating schedule to run the event (hourly, daily, etc.).  See [Schedule Rules](#schedule-rules) below. |
| `interval` | Run the event on a repeating interval, given a starting date/time. |
| `single` | Set a single future exact date/time to run.  Requires an additional `epoch` property, set to the [Unix timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) at which to run. |
| `catchup` | Ensure that *every* scheduled job runs, even if it has to run late. |
| `range` | Set a starting and/or ending date for a repeating event.  Requires additional `start` and/or `end` properties, set to [Unix timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). |
| `blackout` | Set a blackout date/time range when the event *cannot* run.  Requires additional `start` and `end` properties, set to [Unix timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). |
| `delay` | Set an optional starting delay for all scheduled jobs.  Requires an additional `duration` property, set to the number of seconds to delay each job by. |
| `precision` | Set an optional list of exact seconds to fire jobs within the current scheduled minute. |
| `plugin` | Custom scheduler Plugin (user-defined).  Requires an additional `plugin_id` property, as well as a `params` object, for Plugin-defined configuration. |

#### Schedule Rules

The `schedule` type describes a repeating event (when and how frequent it should run jobs).  It works similarly to the [Unix Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) system, with selections of years, months, days, weekdays, hours and/or minutes.  Each property should be an array of numerical values.  If omitted, it means the same as "all" in that category (i.e. asterisk `*` in Cron syntax).

For example, an event with this trigger object would run once per hour, on the hour:

```js
{
	"type": "schedule",
	"enabled": true,
	"minutes": [0]
}
```

It essentially means every year, every month, every day, every hour, but only on the `0` minute.  The scheduler ticks only once a minute, so this only results in running one job for each matching minute.

For another example, this would run twice daily, at 4:30 AM and 4:30 PM:

```js
{
	"type": "schedule",
	"enabled": true,
	"hours": [4, 16],
	"minutes": [30]
}
```

For a more complex example, this would run only in year 2023, from March to May, on the 1st and 15th of the month (but only if also weekdays), at 6AM to 10AM, and on the :15 and :45 of those hours:

```js
{
	"type": "schedule",
	"enabled": true,
	"years": [2023],
	"months": [3, 4, 5],
	"days": [1, 15],
	"weekdays": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
	"hours": [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
	"minutes": [15, 45]
}
```

Here is a list of all the `schedule` type trigger object properties and their descriptions:

| Trigger Property | Range | Description |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| `years` | ∞ | One or more years in YYYY format. |
| `months` | 1 - 12 | One or more months, where January is 1 and December is 12. |
| `days` | 1 - 31 | One or more month days, from 1 to 31. |
| `weekdays` | 0 - 6 | One or more weekdays, where Sunday is 0, and Saturday is 6. |
| `hours` | 0 - 23 | One or more hours in 24-hour time, from 0 to 23. |
| `minutes` | 0 - 59 | One or more minutes, from 0 to 59. |
| `timezone` | n/a | Optional timezone to evaluate the schedule entry in.  Defaults to the master server timezone. |

## Workflow

Workflows are really just [Event](#event)s with an extra `workflow` property, which describes the flow.  See [Workflows](workflows.md) for more details about workflows.  Here is an example workflow object in JSON format:

```json
{
	"nodes": [

	]
}
```

### Workflow.nodes

An array of [WorkflowNode](#workflownode)s in the workflow.

### Workflow.connections

An array of [WorkflowConnection](#workflowconnection)s in the workflow.

## WorkflowNode

A workflow node is an object which represents an event, an ad-hoc job, a trigger, a limit, an action, or a controller.  Here is an example node in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "n05zzi1i",
	"type": "event",
	"data": {
		"event": "emdzenjw3hz",
		"params": {},
		"targets": [],
		"algo": "",
		"tags": []
	},
	"x": 306,
	"y": 235
}
```

### WorkflowNode.id

A unique alphanumeric ID for the node, which is automatically assigned when created.  Workflow Node IDs will always start with `n`.

### WorkflowNode.type

A string constant representing the node type, which will be one of: `event`, `job`, `trigger`, `limit`, `action`, or `controller`.

### WorkflowNode.data

Nodes may have a `data` property which contains information specific to the node type.  Here is a summary of how this property is used:

| Node Type | Data Description |
|-----------|------------------|
| `event` | Will contain an `event` property, which refers to the [Event](#event), as well as properties that override defaults set in the event. |
| `job` | Will contain most of the properties from the [Event](#event) object, to run an ad-hoc job without an explicit event definition. |
| `trigger` | Not used.  Trigger nodes use their [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) property to link to the [Event.trigger](#event-trigger), which is the source of truth for the trigger. |
| `limit` | Will contain properties from the [Limit](#limit) object. |
| `action` | Will contain properties from the [Action](#action) object. |
| `controller` | Will contain properties specific to the controller type.  See below. |

For controller nodes, see the following table for details on how the `data` property is used:

| Controller Type | Data Description |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `multiplex` | Will contain `stagger` (delay in seconds) for staggering jobs across servers, and `continue` (percentage) for gating success. |
| `wait` | Will contain `wait` (delay in seconds). |
| `repeat` | Will contain `repeat` (iteration count), and `continue` (percentage) for gating success. |
| `split` | Will contain `split` (expression to split on), and `continue` (percentage) for gating success. |
| `join` | Not used. |
| `decision` | Will contain `label` (custom title), `icon` (custom icon), and `decision` (expression to evaluate). |

### WorkflowNode.x

The horizontal position of the top-left corner of the node in the UI, measured in CSS pixels at 1X zoom.

### WorkflowNode.y

The vertical position of the top-left corner of the node in the UI, measured in CSS pixels at 1X zoom.

## WorkflowConnection

A workflow connection object represents a connection between two nodes (rendered as a curved line in the UI).  Here is an example connection in JSON format:

```json
{
	"id": "cnns5qvj",
	"source": "n05zzi1i",
	"dest": "nyywkijs",
	"condition": "success"
}
```

### WorkflowConnection.id

A unique alphanumeric ID for the connection, which is automatically assigned when created.  Workflow Connection IDs will always start with `c`.

### WorkflowConnection.source

The [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) of the source node.

### WorkflowConnection.dest

The [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) of the destination node.

### WorkflowConnection.condition

Some connections have a `condition` which dictates when control will flow through to the destination node (namely from a job or event to another node).  See [Action Conditions](#action-conditions) for a list of possible conditions.

## JobWorkflow

When a job starts, if the job is itself a workflow, or a sub-job inside a workflow, it will be given a `workflow` object, which is described below.  Here is an example object in JSON format, for a workflow job, but with some properties removed for brevity:

```json
{
	"nodes": [],
	"connections": [],
	"start": "n1b47xt7",

## JobWorkflow.start

The [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) of the starting node (typically a trigger node).

## JobWorkflow.state

Contains state information for each node in the workflow.  Typically this is used to track which nodes executed, and to track performance.  The object is keyed by the [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id)s of the nodes, with values being specific to each node.  Example in JSON format:

```json
{
	"n1b47xt7": {
		"started": 1762288805.097,
		"completed": 1762288805.102
	},
	"n24wos41": {
		"started": 1762288805.097
	},
	"ns3n5uyn": {
		"started": 1762288811.225
	}
}
```

## JobWorkflow.jobs

Contains information about all completed jobs inside the workflow.  The `jobs` object is keyed by the [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id)s of the nodes which spawned the jobs, and the value is an array of objects (because each node may spawn multiple jobs inside one workflow).  Here is an example:

```json
{
	"ns3n5uyn": [
		{
			"id": "jmhl199ehxh",
			"code": 503,
			"description": "HTTP 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable",
			"server": "smf4j79snhe",
			"completed": 1762288812.95,
			"elapsed": 1.7220001220703125,
			"tags": [
				"_error",
				"_last"
			],
			"files": []
		}
	]
}
```

Each element of the array is a subset of properties copied from the [Job](#job) object.

## JobWorkflow.job

If the job is a sub-job inside of a parent workflow, the `workflow.job` property will point to the [Job.id](#job-id) of the parent workflow job.

## JobWorkflow.event

If the job is a sub-job inside of a parent workflow, the `workflow.event` property will point to the [Event.id](#event-id) of the parent workflow.

## JobWorkflow.node

If the job is a sub-job inside of a parent workflow, the `workflow.node` property will point to the [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) of the event or job node which started the job.

## JobWorkflow.launcher

If the job is a sub-job inside of a parent workflow, the `workflow.launcher` property will point to the [WorkflowNode.id](#workflownode-id) of the controller node which is governing the job.

## Privileges

The Privileges object describes which actions are allowed for a [User](#user), a [Role](#role), or an [API Key](#api-key).  For more details, see [Privileges](privileges.md).  Here is an example set of privileges in JSON format:

```json
{
	"create_events": true,
	"edit_events": true,
	"run_jobs": true,
	"tag_jobs": true,
	"comment_jobs": true,
	"create_tickets": true,
	"edit_tickets": true
}
```

Note that the `admin` privilege, when present, implicitly enables all other privileges.

## JobHookData

## QuickmonData

xyOps captures "quick" monitoring data every second on every server, in a few key areas (CPU / mem / net / disk).  This data is used to render the real-time server monitors, and is used in server snapshots as well.  Here is an example Quickmon data sample in JSON format:

```json
{
	"_qm_cpu_load": 0,
	"_qm_cpu_usage": 0,
	"_qm_disk_read_sec": 7317065728,
	"_qm_disk_write_sec": 104329216,
	"_qm_mem_avail": 16180023296,
	"_qm_mem_used": 630362112,
	"_qm_net_in_sec": 1168348,
	"_qm_net_out_sec": 24974039,
	"date": 1754793680
}
```

The `date` is the sample time in Unix seconds.  The other properties correspond to the Quickmon monitor definitions in [quick_monitors](configuration.md#quick_monitors), and the values should all be raw numbers.

## ServerTimelineData

Every minute, xyOps takes the current [ServerMonitorData](#servermonitordata) from every server, pulls out all the [Monitor](#monitor) values, and stores them in a specialized timeseries database.  Here is an example entry in JSON format:

```json
{
	"count": 1,
	"date": 1754449800,
	"epoch_div": 29240830,
	"totals": {
		"active_jobs": 0,
		"cpu_usage": 0.14,
		"disk_iops_sec": 17188,
		"disk_read_sec": 818495488,
		"disk_usage_root": 5.09,
		"disk_write_sec": 26660864,
		"io_wait": 0,
		"load_avg": 0,
		"mem_free": 16167579648,
		"mem_used": 642805760,
		"mmdze1gznbt": 41861120,
		"net_conns": 4,
		"open_files": 1152,
		"os_bytes_in_sec": 122642,
		"os_bytes_out_sec": 2633375,
		"total_procs": 24
	}
}
```

The object consists of the following properties:

| Property Path | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `count` | Number | The number of samples represented in this DB entry.  For daily, monthly and yearly systems, this will generally be greater than 1, and the totals will all be divided by it (i.e. averaged). |
| `date` | Number | The date/time of the first sample in the DB entry, in Unix seconds. |
| `epoch_div` | Number | The Unix seconds divided by a constant defined by the current system. |
| `totals` | Object | An object containing all the [Monitor](#monitor) totals. |

## File

A file object is used to represent a file in storage.  It is used for [Job.files](#job-files), [Ticket.files](#ticket-files), and [Bucket.files](#bucket-files).  The object consists of the following properties:

| Property Path | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| `path` | String | A normalized path to the file in storage, which can also be used as a URI path for viewing / downloading. |
| `filename` | String | The filename of the file. |
| `size` | Number | The size of the file in bytes. |
| `date` | Number | The file's creation date as Unix seconds. |
| `job` | String | If the file was created from a job, this will contain the [Job.id](#job-id). |
| `server` | String | If the file was created on a server, this will contain the [Server.id](#server-id). |
